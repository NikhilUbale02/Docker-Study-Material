WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python","app.py"]

docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 myapp:1.0
docker history myapp:1.0
docker image prune -f
```

---

- How to secure Dockerfile
- Why use non-root user

---

PHASE 4: DOCKER COMPOSE BASICS

---

Concepts:
- Purpose: orchestrate multi-container apps
- YAML structure: version, services, volumes, networks
- Service to service communication via DNS
- Lifecycle: up, down, ps, logs

---

Examples:
1. Beginner: Single-service Nginx
2. Intermediate: Flask API + Postgres
3. Advanced: Add named volume for Postgres
4. Expert: Add env vars via .env file
5. Pro: Inspect default network, container DNS

---

Lab Exercises:
- Basic: Nginx on port 8080

- Advanced: Add named volume for DB persistence
- Expert: Use .env for credentials

---

Cheat Sheet:
```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
docker compose down -v
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f web

docker-compose.yml:
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
volumes:
  dbdata:
```

  interval: 10s
  retries: 5

docker compose up --scale api=3
docker compose --profile dev up -d
docker compose config
```

---

- Disk usage bloat and pruning
- Log flooding and rotation
- docker stop vs kill
- Production best practices:
  - use .dockerignore
  - pin versions

  - multi-stage builds
  - prefer volumes
  - avoid latest
